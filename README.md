# React-sandbox
A project designed to help me get more comfortable with react. 

# Problem
As User Interfaces become more and more sofisticated, React is becoming more and more widely used. While I have some slight experience with React thanks to internships, said experience is going to fall behind the latest trends and developments of React. 

# Objective
Develop a website with React that contains a home page, a series of other pages, and the ability to create a new page.
