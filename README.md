# React-sandbox
A project designed to help me get more comfortable with react. 

# Problem
As User Interfaces become more and more sofisticated, React is becoming more and more widely used. While I have some slight experience with React thanks to internships, said experience is going to fall behind the latest trends and developments of React. 

# Objective
Develop a website with React that contains a home page, a series of other pages, and the ability to create a new page. 

# Deploy it yourself

1. Ensure you have nodejs installed
  - [Linux](https://techviewleo.com/how-to-install-nodejs-in-linux-mint/)
  - [macOs & Windows](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

| :warning: CAUTION |
|:-------------------------|
| Linux users should not use the <code> sudo apt-get install nodejs </code> method to get react. Doing so will result in the installation of an unsupported version of node that will not work with this program! Also make sure that your node version is at least 16.x and npm 8.x!| 

2. Open a terminal within the root of this project and cd into the sandbox directory
3. Input <code>npm update</code> into the terminal
4. After update completes its operation, input <code>npm start</code> into the terminal. 
5. Your browser should open into localhost:3000 showing the home of this application

# Additional Notes
Compiled in a Linux Mint environment via <code> npm start </code> using npm version 8.5.0 and node version 16.14.2 .
